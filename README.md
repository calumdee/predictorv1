A simple calculation of: 
total form diff * a + position diff * b + location form (home teams home form - away teams away form) * c + home advantage.

The values of A, B, C and home advantage were all calculated by searching all values in a range to find the values that produced the highest total number of correct result over all previous games. 
A very slow process but it gave decent accuracy.
